### Context
* There are two fictitious candidates, each running for President.

* Voting model is based on an electoral college alternative: each state has a set number of votes that they can cast for one of the candidates.

* The number of votes from each state can be used to show who won which state - both in the table on the bottom right and when you mouse over a state.
